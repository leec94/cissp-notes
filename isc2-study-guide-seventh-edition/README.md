### Cabling

#### Coaxial Cable

_coaxial cable_: center core of copper wire surrounded by a layer of insulation, then surrounded by a conductive braided shielding and encased in a final insulation sheath. not used as much anymore, now twisted-pair is the more popular alternative.

- Types
  - _thinnet_: or 10Base2, connected systems to backbond trunks of thicknet cabling, spans distances of 185 meters and throughput up to 10 Mbps
  - _thicknet_: or 10Base5, can span 500 meters and throughput up to 10 Mbps
- Problems
  - Bending coax cable past max arc
  - deploying coax cable past max recommended length
  - not properly terminating the ends of the coax cable with a 50 ohm resistor

#### Baseband and Broadband Cables

_Baseband_: can transmit only one single signal at a time

- most cables are baseband cables

_Broadband_: can transmit multiple signals simultaneously

![network cabling naming convention](chap-11/networkcablenamingconvention.png)

| Type                 | Max Speed | Distance      | Difficulty of Installation | Susceptibility to EMI | Cost      |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 10Base2              | 10 Mbps   | 185 meters    | Medium                     | Medium                | Medium    |
| 10Base5              | 10 Mbps   | 500 meters    | High                       | Low                   | High      |
| 10Base-T (UTP)       | 10 Mbps   | 100 meters    | Low                        | High                  | Very low  |
| STP                  | 155 Mbps  | 100 meters    | Medium                     | Medium                | High      |
| 100Base-T/100Base-TX | 100 Mbps  | 100 meters    | Low                        | High                  | Low       |
| 1000Base-T           | 1 Gbps    | 100 meters    | Low                        | High                  | Medium    |
| Fiber-optic          | 2+ Gbps   | 2+ kilometers | Very High                  | None                  | Very High |

#### Twisted-Pair

_twisted-pair_: four pair wires twisted around each other and sheathed in PVC insulator.

- each wire pair is twisted at a different length so signals traveling over the pairs cannot cross across pairs. the tighter the twist the more resistent the cable is to internal and external interference and crosstalk, and capacity for throughput is greater.
- Types
  - _STP: shielded twisted-pair_, the metal foil wrapper around the wires underneath the external sheath.
  - _UTP: unshielded twisted-pair_, without the foil. refers to 10Base2, 100Base-T, or 1000Base-T, all outdated.
- Problems
  - wrong category of twisted-pair cable for high-throughput networking
  - deloyinh twisted-pair longer than max recommended length
  - using UTP in environments with significant interference

_UTP categories_

| UTP Category | Throughput | Notes                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cat 1        | Voice Only | Not suitable for networks but usable by modems                                            |
| Cat 2        | 4 Mbps     | Not suitable for most networks                                                            |
| Cat 3        | 10 Mbps    | Mostly used in 10Base-T Ethernet networks                                                 |
| Cat 4        | 16 Mbps    | Mostly used in Token Ring networks                                                        |
| Cat 5        | 100 Mbps   | Used in 10Base-TX, FDDI, and ATM networks                                                 |
| Cat 5e       | 100 Mbps   | Enhanced Cat 5 to protect against crosstalk. used by 100Base-T and 1000Base-T deployments |
| Cat 6        | 1,000 Mbps | Used in high-speed networks                                                               |
| Cat 7        | 10 Gbps    | Used on 10 gigabit-speed networks                                                         |

#### Conductors

- Types
  - _Copper_: one of the best and least expensive
  - _Plenum cable_: does not release toxic fumes when burned
  - _fiber-optic cable_: transmits pulses of light rather than electricity.
- Terms
  - _maximum length_: point where level of degradation could interfere with transmission of data.
  - _attenuation_: degradation of signal
  - _repeater_: signal amplification device, boosts the signal strength of an incoming data stream and rebroadcasts it through its second port
  - _concentrator_: same as repeater but it has more than two ports.
    - use of more than four repeaters in a row is discouraged, 5-4-3 rule

### Network Topologies

- _logical topology_: grouping of networked systems into trusted collectives.

#### Ring

- _ring topology_: connects each system as points on a circle. only one system can transmit data at a time. if one segment of the loop is broken, all communication around the loop ceases.
  - _token_: digital hall pass that travels around the ring until a system grabs it. traffic management is performed by a token.

![ring topology](chap-11/ring.gif)

#### Bus

- _bus topology_: connects each system to a trunk cable. all systems on the bus can transmit data simultaneously, which can result in collisions. when data is transmitted, all systems on the network can hear the data. if a single segment fails, communications on all other segments continue uninterrupted. the central trunk line remains a single point of failure.
- rarely used today, because it must be terminated at both ends and any disconnection can take down the entire network.

- Types
  - linear bus: single trunk line with all systems directly connected to it
  - tree bus: single trunk line with branches that can support multiple systems

![bus topology](chap-11/bustopol.gif)

#### Star

- _star topology_: centralized connection device, hub or switch. each system is connected to the central hub by a dedicated segment. if one segment fails, the other segments can continue to function. the central hub is a single point of failure.
- uses less cabling than other topologies, and makes identifying damaged cables easier
- logical bus and logical ring can be implemented as a physical star
  - Ethernet: bus-based but can be deployed as a physical star
  - Token Ring: ring-based but can be deployed as a physical star using MAU
    - MAU: multistation access unit, allows for cable segments to be deployed as a star while internally the device makes logical ring connections

![star topology](chap-11/star.gif)

#### Mesh

- _mesh topology_: connects systems to other systems using numerous paths. provides redundant connections to systems, allowing multiple segment failures without seriously affecting connectivity
  - full mesh topology: connects each system to all other systems on the network
  - partial mesh topology: connects many systems to many other systems.

![mesh topology](chap-11/mesh.gif)

### Wireless Communications and Security

- _frequency_: a measurement of the number of wave oscillations within a specific time and identified using the unit Hertz (Hz), or oscillations per second
  - radio waves have a frequency between 3 Hz and 300 GHz
- _spread spectrum_: communication occurs over multiple frequencies at the same time. a message is broken into pieces and each piece is sent at the same time but at a different frequency, effectively parallel communication.
- _FHSS_: Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum, early implementation of the spread spectrum concept, but transmits data in a series while constantly changing the frequency in use
- _DSSS_: Direct Sequency Spread Spectrum, employs all the available frequencies simultaneously in parallel to provide a higher rate of data throughput than FHSS. also uses chipping code to allow a receiver to reconstruct data even if parts of the signal were distorted because of the interference.
- _OFDM_: Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing, employs a digital multicarrier modulation scheme that allows for a more tightly compacted transmission. The modulated signals are perpendicular (orthogonal) thus do not cause interference with each other

- _WAP_: Wireless Application Protocol, a functioning protocol stack. Suite of protocols working together to connect from cell phone to the Internet.
  - Example of protocol is WTLS, Wireless Transport Layer Security, similar to SSL or TLS
  - NOT the same as WAP, wireless access point, when used in relation to 802.11
  - end-to-end encryption is not possible because of CALEA wiretapping mandate
  - _CALEA_: Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act

#### Bluetooth

- _Bluetooth_: also IEEE 802.15, personal area networks (PANs), is where primary device scans 2.4 GHz radio frequencies for available devices, then 4 digit PIN "authorizes" the pairing. Range is 30 to 100 ft.
  - attacks
    - _bluejacking_: allows an attacker to transmit SMS-like messages to your device
    - _bluesnarfing_: allows hackers to connect to your Bluetooth device and extract information from them
    - _bluebugging_: grants hackers remote control over the feature and functions of a Bluetooth device
  - suggestions:
    - use Bluetooth for activities that are not sensitive or confidential
    - when possible change the default PIN on your devices
    - do not leave your device in discovery mode
    - always turn of Bluetooth when it's not in active use

#### Cordless Phones

- can use any unlicensed frequencies: 900MHz, 2.4GHz, or 5 GHz. Signal is rarely encrypted so eavesdropping is easy with a frequency scanner.

#### Mobile Devices

- suggestions
  - keep nonessential information off portable devices
  - run a firewall and antivirus product if available
  - keep the system locked and/or encrypted if possible
  - check that all desired security features are operating as expected on any device allowed to connect o the organization's network

### LAN Technologies

#### Ethernet

- _ethernet_: shared media LAN technology. Uses broadcast and collision domains
  - can support full-duplex communications and usually employs twisted-pair cabling
  - most often deployed on star or bus topologies
  - based on IEEE 802.3 standard
  - Terms
    - _broadcast domain_: physical grouping of systems where all the systems in the group receive a broadcast sent by a single system in the group.
    - _collision domain_: groupings of systems within which a data collision occurs if two systems transmit simultaneously.
    - _data collision_: takes place when two transmitted messages attempt to use the network medium at the same time. it causes one or both messages to be corrupted
    - _frames_: individual units of Ethernet data

#### Token Ring

- _token ring_: employs a token-passing mechanism to control which systems can transmit data over the network medium
  - the token travels in a logical loop among all members of the LAN 
  - can be deployed on ring or star network topologies 
  - rarely used today because of performance limitations, higher cost, and increased difficulty in deployment and management 
  - ring-based but can be deployed as a physical star using MAU

#### FDDI

- _FDDI_: Fiber Distributed Data Interface, high speed token-passing technology that employs two rings with traffic flowing in opposite directions 
  - often used as a backbone for large enterprise networks 
  - _CDDI_: Copper Distributed Data Interface, uses twisted pair cables, uses less-expensive, distance limited, and slower
    - more vulnerable to interference and eavesdropping

#### Subtechnologies

- _analog_: continuous signal that varies in frequency, amplitude, phase, voltage, etc.
- _digital_: on/off pulses of discontinuous electrical signals
- _synchronous_: relies on a timing mechanism 
- _asynchronous_: relies on stop and start delimiter bit to manage the transmission of data
- _baseband_: support only a single communication channel
- _broadband_: can support multiple simultaneous signals
- _broadcast_: communication to all possible recipients
- _multicast_: communication to multiple specific recipients
- _unicast_: only to a single recipient

#### LAN Media Access

- _CSMA_: Carrier-Sense Multiple Access
  - does not directly address collisions
- _CSMA/CA_: Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
  - examples: appletalk and 802.11
  - attempts to avoid collusions by granting only a single permission to communicate at any given time
  - needs a primary system, to respond to requests and grants permission to send data transmissions
- _CSMA/CD_: Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
  - example: ethernet
  - responds to collisions by having each member of the collision domain wait a random period of time before starting the process over 
- _token passing_: LAN media access technology that communicates using a digital token. 
- _polling_: LAN media access technology that performs communications using a primary / secondary configuration. 
  - SDLC, Synchronous Data Link Control, uses polling
  - inverse of the CSMA/CA method

### VLAN, Virtual LAN

- _VLAN_: used to logically segment a network without altering its physical topology
- VLAN vs subnet
  - VLANs are created by switches, subnets are created by IP address and subnet mask assignments 

### Virtualization 

-_software-defined networking_: separates the infrastructure layer from the control layer, and removes the traditional networking concepts of IP addressing, subnets, routing, etc. from needing to be programmed into hosted applications. directly programmable, network virtualization 

-SAN: storage area network, combines multiple individual storage devices into a single consolidated network-accessible storage container. 

### Network Address Translation 

- NAT: converts internal IP addresses into public IP addresses for transmission over the Internet
- PAT: port address translation 
- private IP addresses
- stateful NAT
- static NAT: 
- dynamic NAT: 
- APIPA: automatic private IP addressing, assigns an IP address to a system in the event of a DHCP assignment failure 
  - primarily a feature of Windows 
  - APIPA assigns each failed DHCP client with an IP address from range 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254

### Switching Technologies
- circuit switching: dedicated physical pathway is created between the two communicating parties
- packet switching: the message is broken up into small segments and sent across the intermediary networks to the destination

## Chapter 13: Managing Identity and Authentication 

### subject vs object
- subject: active entity that accesses an object to receive information about or modify objects.  
  - "user"
- object: passive entity that provides information to active objects. 
  - examples: files, databases, computers, programs, processes, printers, and storage media

### Access Control

overall access control steps
1. identify and authenticate users or other objects attempting to access resources
2. determine whether the access is authorized
3. grant or restrict access based on the subject's identity
4. monitor and record access attempts

#### access control types 

- preventive: attempts to stop unauthorized activity from occurring
  - examples: fences, locks, biometrics, mantraps, lighting, alarm systems, separation of duties policies, job rotation policis, data classification, penetration testing, etc. 
- detective: attempts to discover or detect unwanted or unauthorized activity.
  - operates after the fact and can discover the activity only after it has occurred
  - examples: security guards, motion detectors, recording and reviewing of events captured by security camera or CCTV, job rotation policies, etc. 
- corrective: modifies the environment to return systems to normal after an unwanted or unauthorized activity has occurred 
  - attempts to correct any problems that occurred as a result of a security incident 
  - examples: terminating malicious activity or rebooting a system, antivirus solutions that can remove or quarantine a virus, backup and restore plans, etc. 
- deterrent
- recovery: attempts to repair or restore resources, functions, and capabilities after a security policy violation 
  - an extension of corrective controls but have more advanced or complex abilities 
  - examples: backup and restores, fault-tolerant drive systems, system imaging, server clustering, antivirus software, database or virtual machine shadowing
- directive: attempts to direct, confine, or control the actions of subjects to force or encourage compliance with security policies 
  - examples: security policy requirements, posted notifications, escape route exit signs, monitoring, supervision, and procedures 
- compensation: provides an alternative when it isn't possible to use a primary control, or to increase the effectiveness of a primary control 
  - examples: security policy dictating use of smartcards, and the company issuing hardware tokens to employees as a compensating control, stringer than just a username and password 

categories by how they are implemented
- administrative: policies and procedures defined by an organization's security policy and other regulations or requirements
  - examples: policies, procedures, hiring practices, background checks, classifying and labeling data, etc. 
- logical/technical controls: hardware or software mechanisms used to manage access and to provide protection for resources and systems
  - examples: authentication methods, encryption, constrained interfaces, access control lists, protocols, firewalls, routers, intrusion detection systems, and clipping levels 
- physical controls: physical mechanisms deployed to prevent, monitor, or detect direct contact with systems or areas within a facility
  - examples: guards, fences, motion detectors, locked doors, sealed windows, lights, etc. 

### CIA Triad
- confidentiality
- integrity
- availability

### Identification terms
- identification: process of a subject claiming an identity. all subjects must have unique identities
- authentication: verifies the identity of the subject by comparing one or more factors against a database of valid identities 
- authorization: subjects are granted access to objects based on proven identities 
  - indicates who is trusted to perform specific operations 
- accountability: users and other subjects can be held accountable for their actions when auditing is implemented
  - auditing: the process of tracking and recording subject activities within logs 
  - does not require effective authorization 

### authentication factors 
- Type 1: something you know
  - examples: password, PIN, passphrase
- Type 2: something you have 
  - examples: smartcard, hardware token, memory card, USB drive
- Type 3: something you are or something you do
  - examples: fingerprints, voice prints, retina patterns, iris patterns, face shapes, palm topology, hand geometry 

### passwords 
- type 1 authentication 
- PBKDF2: password-based key derivation function 2, hashing algorithm 
- strong password factors
  - maximum age
  - password complexity
  - password length
  - password history 
- other password type things
  - password phrases
  - cognitive passwords: series of questions about facts or predefined responses that only the subject should know 

### smartcard and tokens

  - PIV: personal identity verificatino cards
  - CAC: common access cards 
- token: password generating device that users can carry with them 
  - synchornous dynamic password tokens

      - FRR: false rejection rate
    - type 2 error: when an invalid subject is authenticated
      - FAR: false acceptance rate
    - CER: crossover error rate 
      - ERR: equal error rate, same as CER
      - used as a standard assessment value to compare the accuracy of different biometric devices 
      - ![CER point](chap-13/cer.jpg)
  - biometric registration
    - enrollment: subject's biometric factor is sampled and stored in the device's database
      - reference profile: or reference template, it is the stored sample
    - throughput rate: the amount of time the system requires the scan a subject and aprove or deny access 
  
### Multifactor authentication
- two-factor authentication: requires two different factors to provide authentication
- SSO: single sign on
  - reduces the number of accounts required for a subject 
device authentication 
- BYOD policy
- device fingerprinting
- tools
  - IdP: SecureAuth Identity Provider

### implementing identity management
- centralized access control: all authorization verification is performed by a single entity within a system
  - can be managed by a small team, administrative overhead is lower
- decentralized access control: various entities located throughout a system performs authorixation verification 
  - often requires several teams or multiple individuals 
  - administrative overhead is higher because changes must be implemented across numerous locations 
  - maintaining consistency across a system is more difficut as the number of access control points increases 
  - changes made to any individual access control point need to be repeated at every access point 
  
### Centralized Access Control

### LDAP: lightweight directory access protocol

#### Kerberos
- KDC: key distribution center
- TGS: ticket granting service
- TGT: ticket-granting ticket
- Ticket: 

##### Ticket logon process
1. The user types a username and password into the client
2. the client encrypts the username with AES for transmission to the KDC
3. the KDC verifies the username against a database of known credentials
4. the KDC generates a symmetric key that will be used by the client and the Kerberos server. It encrypts this with a hash of the user's password. The KDC also generates an encrypted time-stamped TGT
5. The KDC then transmits the encrypted symmetric key and the encrypted time-stamped TGT to the client
6. The client installs the TGT for use until it expires. The client also decrypts the symmetric key using a hash of the user's password. 

##### Steps to access an object
1. The client sends its TGT back to the KDC with a request for access to the resource
2. The KDC verifies that the TGT is valid and checks its access control matrix to verify that the user has sufficient privileges to access the requested resorce
3. The KDC generates a service ticket and sends it to the client
4. The client sends the ticket to the server of service hosting the resource
5. The server or service hosting the resource verifies the validity of the ticket with the KDC
6. Once identity and authorization is verified, Kerberos activity is complete. The server or service host then opens a session with the client and begins communications or data transmission 

### SSO 
#### Federated Identity Management
- Federated identity management is a form of SSO for users to access resources over the Internet 
- federation: can be composed of multiple unrelated networks within a single university campus, multiple organizations sharing resources, or any other group that can agree on a common federated identity management system. Members of the federation match user identities within an organization to federated identities 
- federated identity systems often use SAML, security assertion markup language, or SPML to have a common language. 

##### Markup Languages
- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
- XML: Extensible Markup Language
- SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language
- SPML: Service Provisioning Markup Language
- XSCML: Extensible Access Control Markup Language

#### Other SSO Examples
- scripted access 
- SESAME: secure european system for applications in a multivendor environment
- Kryptoknight
- OAuth
- OpenID

#### Credential management systems
- Windows Credential Manager tool 
- KeePass
- 1Password
- BitWarden
- Lastpass

#### Integrating Identity services
- IDaaS
  - examples: Google and Office 365

#### AAA Protocols
- protocols that use the access control elements of identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability to ensure that users have valid credentials to authenticate and verify that the user is authorized to connect 
- Examples
  - RADIUS: Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
    - used by many ISPs. users can access the ISP from anywhere and the ISP server forwards the user's connection request to the RADIUS server
  - TACACS+: Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System
    - TACACS, alternative to RADIUS
    - Then XTACACS, created by Cisco
    - finally TACACS+, open publically documented protocol, most commonly used of the three protocols
      - encrypts all of the authentication information 
      - TCP port 49
  - Diameter
    - enhanced version of RADIUS
    - uses TCP 3868

### Identity and Access Provisioning Lifecycle
- provisioning 
- account review
- account revocation 

## Chapter 14: Controlling and Monitoring Access
- permissions: allow access to objects such as files
- rights: the ability to take actions
- privileges: the combination of both rights and permissions
### Authorization Mechanisms 
- implicit deny
- access control matrix
- capability tables
- constrained interface
- content-dependent control
- context-dependent control
- need to know
- least privilege
- separation of duties and responsibilities 

#### Defining requirements with a security policy 
- security policy: document that defines the security requirements for an organization
  - physical access controls
  - logical/technical access controls
  - administrative access controls

- discretionary access control: DACs, allows the owner, creator, or data custodian of an object to control and define access to that object. access control is based oon the discretion or decision of the owner 
  - implemented using access control lists (ACLs) on objects 
  - owners make their own changes 

- nondiscretionary access controls: centrally administered 
  - less flexible 
  - examples: rule-based, role-based, lattice-based access controls 
  - 
#### RBAC methods
- role based access control: controls based on a subject's role 
  -  also task-based
  -  prevents privilege creep 
  - useful in dynamic environments with frequent personnel changes 

- privilege creep: tendency for privileges to accrue to users over time as their roles and access needs to change

- task-based access control: TBAC, each user is assigned to an array of tasks. focus is on controlling access by assigned tasks rather than by user identity 

#### Rule-based access control methods
- rule-based access control: rule-BAC, uses a set of rules to determine what can and can't occur on a system 
  - these models have global rules that apply to all subjects 
  - example: firewall 

- attribute-based access control: ABAC, uses policies that include multiple attributes for rules
  - type of rule-BAC, but more specific
  - example: policies for software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN)

#### Mandatory Access Control
- mandatory access control (MAC): relies on classification labels, representing a security domain 
  - lattice based MAC model 
  - prohibitive rather than permissive, and uses implicit deny philosophy, so if users are not specifically granted access to data, then the system denies them access to associated data 
  - more secure than DAC but not as flexible or scalable 
  - example: US military and lables of Confidential, Secret, Top Secret 
  - classifications within a MAC model
    - hierarchical environment: levels of classification
    - compartmentalized environment: no relationship between one security domain and another
    - hybrid environment: combines both hierarchical and compartmentalized concepts so each hierarchical level can contain subdivisions that are isolated from the rest of the security domain 


#### Access control attacks
- key risk management steps: 
  - identifying assets, asset value
  - identifying threats, threat modeling (focused on assets, attackers, or software)
  - identifying vulnerabilities (vulnerability analysis)

- common access control attacks
  - access aggregation attacks
  - password attacks 
  - dictionary attacks
  - brute-force attacks
  - birthday attack
  - rainbow table attacks
  - sniffer attacks
  - spoofing attacks
    - email spoofing
    - phone number spoofing
  - social engineering attacks
    - phishing
    - spear phishing
    - whaling 
    - vishing 
  - smartcard attacks
  - Denial-of-Service attacks

### prevent or mitigate access control attacks 
- controls to help protect attacks
  - control physical access to systems
  - control electronic access to files
  - encrypt password files
  - create strong password policy 
  - use password masking
  - deploy multifactor authentication
  - use account lockout controls
  - use last logon notification 
  - educate users about security 

## Chapter 15: Security Assessment and Testing
- three major components of security assessment program
  - security tests
    - verify that a control is functioning properly
    - examples: automated scans, tool-assissted pen tests, and manual attempts to undermine security
  - secuity assessments
    - comprehensive reviews of the security of a system, application, or other tested environment
    - risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities in the tested environment and make recommendations if needed
    - examples: security testing tools, thoughtful review of threat environment, current and future risks, and value of the targeted environment 
    - main work: assessment report addressed to management that contains the results of the assessment in nontechnical language and concludes with specific recommendations for improving the security of the tested environment
    - for internal use only 
  - security audits
    - similar to assessments but must be performed by independent auditors 
    - demonstrating effectiveness of controls to a third party. provides an impartial, unbiased view of the state of security controls 
    - types of audits
      - internal audits
        - performed by an organization's internal audit staff and intended for internal audiences 
      - external audits
        - by an outside auditing firm 
        - high degree of external validity because the auditors performing the assessment have no conflict of interest with the organization itself 
### design and validate assessment and test strategies
- vulnerability assessments 
  - vulnerability scans 
    - types:
      - network discovery scans 
        - techniques:
          - TCP SYN scanning
          - TCP connect scanning
          - TCP ACK scanning
          - Xmas scanning
      - network vulnerability scans
        - probes targeted system or network for the precense of known vulnerabilities
      - web application vulnerability scan
        - look for known vulnerabilities in web applications
        - when to scan:
          - scan when beginning to perform web vulnerability scanning for the first time to detect issues with legacy applications
          - scan new application before moving it into a production environment for the first time
          - scan any modified application before code changes move into production
          - scan all applications on a recurring basis 
      - penetration testing
        - attempts to exploit systems 
        - example process
          - perform basic reconnaissance
          - network discovery scans 
          - network vulnerability scans 
          - web application vuln scans 
          - use of exploit toools to attempt to defeat system security
          - manual probing and attack attempts
        - types
          - white box penetration test
            - bypasses many reconnaissance steps, as attackers are provided detailed information about the systems they target 
          - gray box penetration test
            - also partial knowledge tests, common when black box test results are desired byt costs or time constraints mean that some knowledge is needed to complete the testing
          - black box penetration test
            - does not provide attackers with any information prior to the attack

### conduct security control testing

- code review: foundation of software assessment programs 
  - fagan inspections: most formal code review process
      1. planning
      2. overview
      3. preparation
      4. inspection
      5. rework
      6. follow-up
- static testing: evaluates the security of software without running it by analyzing the source code or the compiled application 
- dynamic testing: evaluates the security of software in a runtime environment and is often the only option for organizations deploying applications written by someone else 
  - synthetic transactions: scripted transactions with known expected results 
- fuzz testing: specialized dynamic testing technique that provides many different types of input to stress its limits and find previously undetected flaws 
  - mutation (dumb) fuzzing: takes previous input values from actual operation of the software and manipulates it to create fuzzed input 
  - generational (intelligent) fuzzing: develops data models and creates new fuzzed input based on an understanding of the types of data used by the program 
- interface testing
  - assess the performance of modules against the interface specifications to ensure that they will work together properly when all of the development efforts are complete
   
### key performance and risk indicators 

- metrics to monitor 
  - number of open vulnerabilities 
  - time to resolve vulnerabilities 
  - number of compromised accounts 
  - number of software flaws detected in preproduction scanning
  - repeat audit findings
  - use attempts to visit known malicious sites 

## Chapter 16: Managing Security Operations
- due care
- due diligence
- need to know: focuses on permissions and ability to access information
  - granting users access only to data or resources they need to perform work tasks
- least privilege: focuses on privileges
  - subjects are granted only the privileges necessary to perform work tasks and no more
  - entitlement: the amount of privileges granted to users, typically when first provisioning an account 
  - aggregation: the amount of privileges that users collect over time 
  - transitive trust: allows subjects in one domain to access objects in the other domain 
- separation of duties: two or more users verify each other's actions and must work in concert to accomplish necessary work tasks 
  - two or more people must conspire or collude against the organization, which increases the risk for these people 
  - no single person has sufficient access to circumvent or disable security mechanisms 
- segregation of duties: least privilege with separation of duties 
  - ideally personnel will never be assigned to two roles with a conflict of interest 
- two-person control
- job rotation
- mandatory vacations
- monitor special privileges 
  - privileged entities
  - regular users 
- data controls over life cycle
  - marking data: labeling data
  - handling data: transporting data
  - storing data: requires protection against losses
  - destroying data: needs to be destroyed in a way that is not readable
- service level agreements (SLA): an agreement between an organization and an outside entity 
  - MOU: memorandum of understanding
  - ISA: interconnection security agreement 

- managing resources thoughout lifecycle
  - hardware: bar-code systems, RFID tags, sanitizing eqipment, 
  - software licensing: license key protections, inspecting authorized software, ConfigMgr to identify unauthorized software running on systems
  -  physical assets: fences, barricades, guards, for building contents physical protection
     -  locate sensitive physical assets towards center of building 
  -  virtual assets: 
     -  examples: virtual machines, software-defined networks (SDNs), virtual storage area networks (CSANS)
     -  components: hypervisor
  -  cloud based assets: must ensure security controls are in place 
     -  should finally define requirements to store and process data in the cloud
     -  types: 
        -  Software as a Service (Saas)
        -  Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        -  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
-  media management
   -  tape media 
      -  highly susceptible to loss due to corruption, so oftentimes two copies: one for onsite and one offsite secure location. 
      -  should not be exposed to magnetic fields from elevator motors, printers, and older CRT monitors 
   -  mobile devices 
      -  safeguards: encryption, remote wipe, screen lock, BYOB policies
   -  USB flash drives
      -  risks: malware infectons, data theft 
      -  some brands exists that do hardware encryption, deny access, and self destruct 
   -  media life cycle 
      -  MTTF: mean time to failure 
         -  after, should be destroyed 
      -  MTBF: mean time between failures
         -  the time expected to lapse between failutes that a personnel will repair such as a computer server

### managing configuration
- baselining: starting point 
  - checklists that require someone to make sure a system is deployed a certain way or with a specific configuration 
  - automated methods reduce potential for errors than manual baselines
  - often uses images 
    1. admin installs operating system and all desired applications on a computer, and configures them with relevant security and other settings to meet the needs of the organization. next perform extensive testing to ensure the system operaties as expected before proceeding to the next step
    2. next admin captures an image of the system and stores it on a server 
    3. personnel then deploys the image to systems as needed
    - example, government has USGCB, US gov't config baseline, and mantained and updated by NIST

### managing change
- security impact analysis: evaluating changes to identify any security impacts before personnel deploys changes in a production environment
  - done by a change management process
  - common change management processes
    - request the change
    - review the change 
    - approve/reject the change
    - schedule and implement the change 
    - document the change
  - emergency change: sometimes required, but still needs to document the changes 
  - mandatory element for SARs, security assurance requirements in the ISO common criteria
- versioning
  - version control used in software configuration management, to manage changes that may break and allow for roll backs
- configuration documentation
  - identifies the current configuration of systems 
    - who is responsible for the system
    - the purpose of the system 
    - lists all changes applied to the baseline

### managing patches and reducing vulnerabilities
- patch management: ensures that systems are kept up-to-date with current patches 
  - patch: term for any type of code written to correct a bug or vulnerability or improve the performance of existing software 
    - other terms: updates, quick fixes, hot fixes 
  - steps for patch management
    - evaluate patches 
    - test patches
    - approve the patches 
    - deploy the patches 
    - verify the patches are deployed 
- vulnerability management: regularly identifying vulnerabilities, evaluating them, and taking steps to mitigate risks associated with them 
  - CVEs: common vulnerabilities and exposures
    - database of vulnerabilities 
## Chapter 17: Preventing and Responding to Incidents
### managing incident respone
- incident: any event that has a negative effect on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an organization's assets 
  - types:
    - direct attacks
    - natural occurrences, earthquakes or hurricanes
    - accidents, accidentally cutting cables 
- computer security incident (or security incident): incident result of an attack, or the result of malicious or intential actions on the part of users 
  - examples:
    - any attempted network intrusion
    - any attempted denial-of-service atack
    - any detection of malicious software
    - any unauthorized access of data
    - any violation of security policies
#### incident response steps
1. detection
2. response
3. mitigation
4. reporting
5. recovery 
6. remediation
7. lessons learned

- detection: it personnel investigates events and determines it is a security incident
  - examples:
    - intrusion detection and prevention systems
    - anti-malware software 
    - automated tools scanning audit logs looking for predefined events 
    - irregular activity reported by end users
- response: team assists in investigating the incident, assessing the damage, collecting evidence, reporting the invident, and recovery procedures 
  - teams to respond
    - CIRT: computer incident response team
    - CSIRT: computer security incident response team 
- mitigation: attempts to contain an incident
- reporting: reporting an incident within the organization and to organizations and indeviduals outside the organization 
  - organizations often have a legal requirement to report some incidents outside of the organization: country compliance laws, privacy laws, and possibly official agencies (FBI, INTERPOL, etc)
- recovery: returning system to a fully functioning state. may include completely rebuilding a system
- remediation: personnel look at the incident, attempt to identify what allowed it to occur, and then implement methods to prevent it from happening again. 
  - includes root cause analysis: examining the incident to determine what allowed it to happen 
- lessons learned: personnel examine the incident and the response to see if there are any lessons to be learned
  - output of this stage can be fed back to the detection stage of incident management
  - report is often created to recommend changes to procedures, addition of security controls, or even changes to policies 

### implementing preventive measures

#### basic preventative measures 
- keep systems and applications up-to-date
- remove or disable unneeded services and protocols
- use intrusion detection and prevention systems 
- use up-to-date anti-malware software 
- use firewalls 

#### attacks
- denial-of-service (DoS) attacks: attacks that prevent a system from processing or responding to legitimate traffic or requests for resources and objects. 
  - results in system crashes, system reboots, data corruption, blockage of services, and more. 
  - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack: variant of DoS, manipulating traffic or a network service so that the attacks are reflected back to the victim from other sources 
    - examples: DNS poisoning attacks and smurf attacks
- SYN flood attack
  - DoS attacks that disrupts the standard three-way handshake used by TCP to initiate communication sessions. the attacker sends multiple SYN packets but never completes the connection with an ACK, hundreds or thousands 
  - prevention: 
    - SYN cookies: small records that the system checks when receives an ACK to establish a session. 
    - firewalls to check for SYN attacks 
    - IDS/IPS 
    - reduce the amount of time a server will wait for an ACK 
- TCP reset attack: attacks spoof the source IP address in a RST packet and disconnect active sessions 
- smurf attack
  - DoS attack: another type of flood attack, but floods the victim with ICMP echo packets instad of with TCP SYN packets 
    - a spoofed broadcast ping request using the IP address of the victim as the source IP address 
    - rarely a problem today due to routers not defaulted to directing broadcast traffic, and its common to disable ICMP on firewalls, routers, and even many servers 
- fraggle attack
  - similar to smurf attacks, but instead of ICMP, a fraggle attack uses UDP packets over UDP ports 7 and 19, and broadcasts a UDP packet using the spoofed IP address of the victim. 
- ping flood  
  - floods a victim with ping requests, example is when launched by zombies within a botnet as a DDoS attack, and system becomes overwhelmed responding to the ping requests
- botnets: computers all controlled by a bot herder and perform attacks in coordination of sometimes over 40,000 computers 
  - bot herder: criminal who controls all the computers in the botnet, to send spam, phishing emails, or rent the botnets out to other criminals 
  - gameover zeus: botnet that collected credentials for financial systems and performed banking fraud, infected 1 million systems by June 2014 
- ping of death: oversized ping packet, changed from normally 32 - 64 bytes to over 64KB, bigger than many systems can handle. can cause buffer overflow or system crash. not common today because patches and updates remove the vulnerability
- teardrop: attacker fragments traffic in a way that a system is unable to put data packets back together by mangling packets that are split up in transit
  - current systems are not susceptible to teardrop attacks
- land attacks: attacker sends a spoofed SYN packet to a victim using the victim's IP address as both the source and destination IP address. may cause system to reply to itself and cause it to freeze, crash, or reboot 
- zero-day exploit: an attack on a system exploiting a vulnerability that is unknown to others. could be discovered by an attacker or vender first. once a patch is released, it is no longer a zero-day exploit, it is an attack on an unpatched system 
- malicious code (malware): any script that performs an unwanted, unauthorized, or unknown activity on a computer system
  - drive-by download: code downloaded and installed on a user's system without the user's knowledge 
- man-in-the-middle attacks: a malicious user is able to gain a position logically between the two endpoints of an ongoing communications 
  - two types: sniffer attack and proxy mechanism
- war dialing: using a modem to search for a system that accepts inbound connection attempts 
  - also occurs over VoIP, example WarVOX, a wardialing tool that uses VoIP 
  - countermeasures: strong remote access security, callback security, ensuring no unauthorized modems are present within the organization, restricting what protocolscan be used, and using call logging
- sabotage: criminal act of destruction or disruption committed against an organization by an employee
- espionage: gathering proprietary, secret, sensitive, or confidential information about an organization, then selling the information to a competitor or other interested organization

#### countermeasures
- intrusion detection and prevention systems: 
  - intrusion detection system (IDS): automates inspection of logs and real-time events to detect intrusion attempts and system failures 
  - intrusion prevention system (IPS): all capabilities of IDS but also additionl steps to stop or prevent intrusion 
    - an IDP placed in line with traffic. if not in line, then not a true IPS because it can only response to the attack after it has detected an attack in progress 
  - resources:  
    - NIST SP 800-94
- knowledge-based detection
  - IDS method of detection
  - also signature-based detection or pattern-matching detection 
  - matches on signatures, or known patterns to match against, like anti-malware applications
  - effective only on known attack methods 
  - must be regularly updated with new attack signatures 
- behavior-based detection
  - IDS method of detection
  - also statistical intrusion detection, anomaly detection, and heuristics-based detection 
  - first creates a baseline of normal activities and events on the system, then once it has baseline data then it can detect abnormal activity that may indicate a malicious intrusion or event 
  - could detect newer attacks that have no signatures and are not detectable with the signature-based method 
  - drawback: often raises a high number of false alarms, false alerts, false positives 
- IDS response
  - passive response: logs the event and sends a notification
    - network operations centers (NOCs): get the results of notifications 
  - active response: changes the environment to block the activity in addition to logging and sending a notification 
    - can modify ACLs to block traffic based on ports, protocols, and source addresses
- Host-based IDS (HIDS): monitors a single computer or host 
  - can detect anomalies on the host system that NIDS cannot detect 
  - many include anti-malware capabilities 
  - disadvantages
    - most costly to manage than NIDS 
    - cannot detect network attacks on other systems 
    - consumes a significant amount of system resources, degrading the host system performance
    - logs are maintained on the system so HIDS are easier for an intuder to discover and disable
- Network-based IDS (NIDS): monitors a network by observing network traffic patterns 
  - application-based IDS: monitors traffic between web server and database server looking for suspicious activity 
  - central console is often installed on a single-purpose computer that is hardened against attacks, to operate almost invisibly
  - can discover the source of an attack by performing a Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) or reverse DNS lookips 
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): special type of IDS that attempts to detect and block attacks before they reach target systems 
  - placed in line with traffic so IPS chooses what traffic to forward and what traffic to block after analyzing it, to prevent an attack from reaching the target 
- Darknet: a portion of allocated IP addresses within a network that are not used. legitimate traffic should not be in the darknet, so unless there is a misconfiguration on the network, traffic in the darknet is not legitimate 

#### specific preventative measures
- honeypots: individual computers created as a trap for intruders
  - honeynet: two or more networked honeypots used together to simulate a network
- understanding pseudo flaws: false vulnerabilities or apparent loopholes intentionally implanted in a system in attempt to tempt attackers
- understanding padded cells: similar to honeypot but intrusion isolation is used by a padded cell. a padded cell is a simulated environment with fake data to retain an intruder's interest, but transfered by the IDS 
- warning banners: informs users and intruders about basic security policy guidelines, similar to "no trespassing" sign
- anti-malware: malware signature files that can detect new and modified malware  
- whitelisting and blacklisting
- firewalls
- sandboxing
- third-party security services 
- penetration testing
